400 Bad Request
The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

401 Unauthorized (RFC 7235)
Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. 

403 Forbidden
The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action. This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action.

404 Not Found 
The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

500 Internal Server Error
A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable
